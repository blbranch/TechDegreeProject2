#Paginating and Filtering 
##TechDegreeProject2
This project users JavaScript to paginate, or display a long lists across multiple pages rather than a single one.  It also dynamically creates navigation links corresponding to the length of the list and the page display limit, which I set to 10.  After clicking a link the list is filtered to show only the students that fall within a given range.  

I also created a search bar that also dynamically filters the list with each key stroke.
Paginating and filtering ultimately creates a better user experience for the end-user so they don't have to scroll through long lists.
